//! Rust library for processing NVIDIA Falcon assembly.
//!
//! # About the Falcon
//!
//! The **Fa**st **L**ogic **Con**troller is a series of general-purpose embedded
//! microprocessors that have been produced since around 2005. With over three
//! billion units shipped, the Falcon has been used in many different places and
//! platforms, primarily NVIDIA GPUs starting from G98, but really everywhere a
//! controller for logic processing was needed.
//!
//! Falcon units consist of:
//!
//! - the core processor with its SRAM for code and data
//! - the I/O space for communication with host systems
//! - FIFO interface logic (optional)
//! - memory interface logic (optional)
//! - cryptographic AES coprocessor, making the Falcon a "secretful unit" (optional)
//! - unit-specific logic to control, depending on how the processor is used (optional)
//!
//! # The Instruction Set Architecture
//!
//! The inner workings of Falcon assembly are documented elsewhere. If you see this
//! disclaimer, odds are pretty high that nobody has started to work on it yet.
//!
//! The heart of this crate is the [`Instruction`] structure. Objects should never
//! be created manually, unless you know what you are doing. Rather, instances
//! should be obtained through the [`read_instruction`] function, which disassembles
//! a chunk of binary data into Falcon assembly.
//!
//! See the respective documentation for more details on the usage possibilities.
//!
//! ## Pretty-printing instructions
//!
//! Instructions implement the [`Display`] trait so they can emit valid assembly code
//! for the wrapped instruction which could be thrown at an assembler.
//!
//! ```
//! let instruction = faucon_asm::read_instruction(&mut &[0xBFu8, 0x1Fu8][..])
//!     .expect("Failed to disassemble the given bytes into a valid instruction");
//!
//! assert_eq!(instruction.to_string(), "ld b32 $r15 D[$r1]");
//! ```
//!
//! ## Instruction operands
//!
//! Of course, an [`Instruction`] object lets you access its operands which are used to
//! execute the operation. There are various types of operands in Falcon assembly:
//!
//! - registers (`$r0`, `$sp`, ...)
//! - immediates (`0xAB`, `-0x98`, ...)
//! - CPU flags from the `$flags` register (`pX`, `c`, ...)
//! - direct memory accesses (`D[$sp + 0xAB]`, `I[$r0 + $r4]`, ...)
//!
//! To work with these data efficiently, Falcon wraps up the values and corresponding
//! metadata in the [`Operand`] enumeration. A list of instruction operands can be
//! obtained through [`Instruction::operands`].
//!
//! ## Comparing instructions
//!
//! In Falcon assembly, it is quite usual that [`Instruction`]s have multiple variants
//! with different opcodes and different operand combinations. To compare the natures
//! of instructions, [`Instruction::kind`] exposes an [`InstructionKind`] variant.
//!
//! ```
//! let instruction = faucon_asm::read_instruction(&mut &[0xBFu8, 0x1Fu8][..])
//!     .expect("Failed to disassemble the given bytes into a valid instruction");
//!
//! assert_eq!(instruction.kind(), faucon_asm::InstructionKind::LD);
//! ```
//!
//! # Assembling instructions
//!
//! Functionality for assembling intermediate representation to machine code is
//! currently unsupported and planned for the future.
//!
//! For the time being, it is advised to use `envyas` from the [envytools]
//! collection.
//!
//! # Disassembling instructions
//!
//! As mentioned previously, the [`read_instruction`] can be used to disassemble
//! raw instruction bytes into [`Instruction`] objects. The function can be called
//! repeatedly on a buffer of code until an error or [`Error::Eof`] occurs.
//!
//! It is within the user's responsibility to ensure that all possible exceptions
//! are handled correctly.
